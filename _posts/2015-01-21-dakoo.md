![At the Bypannahalli Metro Station]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/atMetroStn.jpg)

Ramana woke me up with his new designs for my old code. Its actually one of the better ways to be rudely woken up. He wanted to show that that python could be almost as efficient as c. Well it was an interesting exercise and though python is of course no c replacement -  it certainly is a decent alternative for data crunching.

Had finished most of the work by afternoon and sat through the probability class- its going nicely and i would do good to lay a proper ground work for my probability knowledge base. I have a haunch this subject is going to stand me in good stead in future.

Had a small skirmish with Diksha too.

Evening was the awesome part. Hema had invited us to her home. Its in the HAL officer's colony at Bypannahalli. We left in three groups on auto for the mg road metro station. Picked up sweets on the way. While others waited on the platform - Sameer, Rohit and I spotted a chat shop near the station gate and tried hands at various fare. Not so much Rohit as he was just being grumpy. The place is ok. The metro ride was fun. My second till now.

The house is awesome. I guess I will do well to join the services. Aunty porvided us with sumptuous food - gobhi dosa being a novelty for me. We played like kids in the garden of the bunglow. Chain chor, dodge ball, beech ka bandar, loads of random chatting, watching big screen TV and generally having a good time.
