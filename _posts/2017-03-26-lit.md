## Summary

This paper is motivated out of the need to know the rate at which dislocations overcome obstacle. To that end, it examines the efficacy of various direct and indirect atomistic techniques in computing this rate and compares the results.

The techniques studied in this manuscript are as follows :
 - Transition state theories
 - Finite Temperature string method
 - Transition Interface Sampling

The paper illustrates the implementation and prediction difficulties
associated with each of these techniques. The TST model was found
incapable of predicting the rate even for a small example problem where
direct MD could be used - plausibly due to the harmonic approximation. The FTS approach was also found lacking in its key assumptions.

The TIS approach was found to be the most accurate in predicting the rate and was
used to determine temperature and stress dependencies.

**A brief description of each of the technique should follow here.**

**Details of the MD simulation implementations should also follow here.**

The simulation cell consisted of an edge dislocation in an FCC Al lattice and a
mono-layer Cu obstacle representing a GP-Zone. The simulation box, contained
approximately 13000 atoms, with 13 Cu atoms in the obstacle. The box was bounded
by (1-1 0), (1 1 1) and (-1 -1 2) faces in the X, Y and Z directions respectively.

The results from these indirect methods were compared with direct MD
calculations.

Most importantly, this paper illustrated how some physical quantities/conditions
affect rate at which dislocations overcome obstacles.

* Temperature Effect

* Load Effect
