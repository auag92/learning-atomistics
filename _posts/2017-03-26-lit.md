## Summary

This paper seeks to compute the rate at which dislocations overcome obstacles,
through various direct and indirect atomistic techniques and compare the results.

The techniques studied in this manuscript are as follows :
 - Transition state theories
 - Finite Temperature string method
 - Transition Interface Sampling

The paper illustrates the implementation the difficulties
associated with each of these techniques. The TST model was found
incapable of predicting the rate even for a small exaple problem where
direct MD could be used. The FTS approach was also found lacking in its
key assumptions.

The TIS approach was found to be most accurate in predicting the rate and was
used to determine temperature and stress dependencies.

**A brief description of each of the technique should follow here.**

**Details of the MD simulation implementations should also follow here.**

The results from these indirect methods were compared with direct MD
calculations.

Most importantly, this paper illustrated how some physical quantities/conditions
affect rate at which dislocations overcome obstacles.

* Temperature Effect

* Load Effect


This manuscript gives a general idea of why it is important to know the rate
