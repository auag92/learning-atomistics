## Summary

This paper seeks to compute the rate at which dislocations overcome obstacles,
through various direct and indirect atomistic techniques.

The techniques studied in this manuscript are as follows :
 - Transition state theories
 - Finite Temperature string method
 - Transition Interface Sampling

A brief description of each of the technique should follow here.

Details of the simulation implementations should also follow here.

The results from these indirect methods were compared with direct MD
calculations.
