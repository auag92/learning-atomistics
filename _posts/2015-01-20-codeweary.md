Mixed feelings are not good. Fence sitting never is and its worse when one can't be sure about ones own fickle mind.

I hate it. I have been weary and struggling with the code since morning. Its like a war of attrition between me and the problem set. A sequence of prolonged agonies interspersed with discovery of minor bugs that bring temporary hope only to be vanquished by another flood of NANs. Yet, when finally as the day ends and theres some sign of breakthrough - that little joy probably justifies the whole ordeal. Also, I go to class where dear sir puts us through the regular third degree and one comes back feeling to need to report to infirmary for a dose of IV supplements. And yet it all feels good. The class has been awesome and finally the concepts are falling into place.

Why does it all have to be so complicated?
