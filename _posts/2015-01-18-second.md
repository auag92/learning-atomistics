The new year seems old news and i am back in my lab after a short, sweet and bitterly cold winter vacation with family.

Kindle has been an awesome new year's gift. I am really thankfull to Neha, Sameer and all the other guys. I simply can't keep it away and i am afraid this will enhance my already pronounced antisocial tendencies.

I wanted to list my new year resolutions and stuff I would like to do over the year to this post.
I am going to keep adding more stuff to this post over time.

thats all for now.
Good day!
