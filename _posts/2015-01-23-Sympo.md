Attended the symposium at the department today. Sanjay Sondhi, a senior
researcher from GE India technology centre had come to give a guest lecture which I
conveniently missed having stayed up late last night trying to make this blog fully
functional.

However he had had a post lunch interaction with folks involved in materials
modeling which I attended. A few interesting nuggets from his side which I happened to note:

>"basic technical excellence, the ability to work well with others-
>inspire them to work on your ideas and learn from them"

>"based on the observables propose a hypothesis and design diagnostic experiments
>to validate or disprove the hypothesis."

>"if you claim to be passionate you should be able to show that in interview."

>"Build a personal brand even within a team so that people know you are the one to approach"
