We want to predict the rate at which dislocations can overcome obstacles.

Why is this important?
What all stuff affect this rate?
 - controlling for type dislocation
 - controlling for type of obstacles
 - length of dislocation
 - angular posititon vis-a-vis the obstacle

Apparently, the outcome of dislocationâ€“obstacle interactions can be highly sensitive to the nanoscale details of the interaction.
