We want to predict the rate at which dislocations can overcome obstacles.

Why is this important?

What all stuff affect this rate?

 - controlling for type of dislocation
 - controlling for type of obstacles
 - length of dislocation
 - angular position vis-a-vis the obstacle
 - Temprature
 - Stress State

The outcome of dislocationâ€“obstacle interactions can be highly sensitive to the nanoscale details of the interaction - hence the need for atomistic scale simulations.
